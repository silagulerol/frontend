    <h1>Flexbox is Awesome</h1>
    <!-- 
    The main idea behind flex layout is to give the container the ability 
    to alter its items' widt/height (and order) to best fill the available space
    (mostly to accomodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes) 
    Flexbox includes set of properties,Some of them meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as "flex container")
    whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said "flex items")
    MY CONTAINER IS DIV ELEMENT and my container needs to have a flexbox applied to it-->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="flex-item" id="flex-item-1"></div>
        <div class="flex-item" id="flex-item-2"></div>
        <div class="flex-item" id="flex-item-3"></div>
    </div>
